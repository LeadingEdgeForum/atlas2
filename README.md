Folks, 

after a seven-years-long adventure with Atlas2, my priorities have changed so significantly I am no longer able to maintain Atlas2 properly.

However, I am not leaving you without any tooling support. The wonderful community experiments with different ways of Wardley Maps creation and management, and I am sure you will find a tool that suits your needs [here](https://list.wardleymaps.com/#apps).

Thank you so much for your ongoing support and patience!
